## Installing

Using npm:

```bash
# You can use any wallet selector version you want
npm install @wpdas/naxios @near-wallet-selector/modal-ui@9.0.3
```

Using yarn:

```bash
# You can use any wallet selector version you want
yarn add @wpdas/naxios @near-wallet-selector/modal-ui@9.0.3
```

## How to Use

### Preparing it

Import the NEAR Wallet Selector styles. The app needs it to render the Wallet Selector correctly.

```ts
import '@near-wallet-selector/modal-ui/styles.css'
```

### Using It

It's super easy to get a Wallet and/or Contract API in place all at once. Take a look:

```ts
// web3Api.ts
import naxios from '@wpdas/naxios'

const naxiosInstance = new naxios({
  rpcNodeUrl: 'https://free.rpc.fastnear.com', // optional
  contractId: CONTRACT_ID,
  network: 'testnet',
})

/**
 * NEAR Wallet API (Must be a single instance)
 */
export const walletApi = naxiosInstance.walletApi()

// Examples of contract API instance usage

/**
 * Contract API
 * This is going to use default contractId (CONTRACT_ID)
 */
export const contractApi = naxiosInstance.contractApi()

/**
 * Another Contract API
 */
export const socialDBcontractApi = naxiosInstance.contractApi({ contractId: 'v1.social08.testnet' })

/**
 * Greeting Contract API
 */
export const greetingContractApi = naxiosInstance.contractApi({
  contractId: 'dev-1692221685438-15421910364142',
})

/**
 * NEAR RPC API
 */
export const rpcApi = naxiosInstance.rpcApi()
```

#### Opening the Sign-in Wallet Selector Modal

You can open up the NEAR Wallet Selector modal by calling `signInModal()`:

```ts
import { walletApi } from './web3Api'

walletApi.signInModal()
```

</div>

#### Customizing the Wallets Options for NEAR Wallet Selector

By default, naxios only uses **@near-wallet-selector/my-near-wallet** as a means of connecting the wallet. However, you can add other wallet selectors as follows:

```sh
npm install @near-wallet-selector/ledger @near-wallet-selector/my-near-wallet
```

Then, you can start naxius as follows:

```ts
import naxios from '@wpdas/naxios'
import { setupMyNearWallet } from '@near-wallet-selector/my-near-wallet'
import { setupLedger } from '@near-wallet-selector/ledger'

const naxiosInstance = new naxios({
  contractId: CONTRACT_ID,
  network: 'testnet', // or mainnet, localnet
  walletSelectorModules: [setupMyNearWallet(), setupLedger()],
})

/**
 * NEAR Wallet API (Must be a single instance)
 */
export const walletApi = naxiosInstance.walletApi()
```

Find out all the NEAR wallet selectors here: [**NEAR Wallet Selector**](https://github.com/near/wallet-selector)

#### Contract API Reference

- `view`: Make a read-only call to retrieve information from the network. It has the following parameters:
  - `method`: Contract's method name.
  - `props?`: an optional parameter with `args` for the contract's method.
  - `config?`: currently, this has the `useCache` and `expirationTime` prop. When useCache is true, this is going to use non-expired cached data instead of calling the contract's method. expirationTime prop can be used to overwrite the default expiration time set while calling `contractApi` method.
- `call`: Call a method that changes the contract's state. This is payable. It has the following parameters:
  - `method`: Contract's method name
  - `props?`: an optional parameter with `args` for the contract's method, `gas`, `deposit` to be attached and `callbackUrl` if you want to take the user to a specific page after a transaction succeeds.
- `callMultiple`: Call multiple methods that change the contract's state. This is payable and has the following parameters:
  - `transactionsList`: A list of Transaction props. You can use `buildTransaction(...)` to help you out
  - `callbackUrl?`: A page to take the user to after all the transactions succeed.

#### Wallet API Reference

- `accounts`: Signed-in Accounts.
- `accountId`: Main/first signed-in account ID in the accounts list.
- `contractId`: Contract ID.
- `initNear`: Initializes a connection to the NEAR blockchain. This is called automatically when there's any contract interaction.
- `network`: Current network (`testnet`, `mainnet` or `localnet`).
- `recentlySignedInWallets`: Returns ID-s of 5 recently signed in wallets.
- `selectedWalletId`: Selected Wallet Id
- `signInModal`: Open up the Signin Wallet Modal.
- `wallet`: Wallet instance.
- `walletSelector`: WalletSelector instance.

### Contract View

Using a `view` method is free.

```ts
import { greetingContractApi } from './web3Api'

// [free]
greetingContractApi.view<string>('get_greeting').then((response) => console.log(response))
```

### Contract Call

You need to pay for every request you make for a `call` method. This is going to change data and store it within the blockchain.

```ts
import { greetingContractApi } from './web3Api'

// Set greeting [payable]
const args: { message: 'Hi there!!!' }
greetingContractApi.call<string | undefined>('set_greeting', args).then((response) => console.log(response || 'done!'))
```

### Contract Multiple Calls at Once

As well as the `call`, you will need to pay for every request you make. This is going to change data and store it within the blockchain.

```ts
import { buildTransaction } from '@wpdas/naxios'
import { contractApi } from './web3Api'

// Using the default instance's contract
const transactionA = buildTransaction('set_greeting', { args: { greeting: 'Hello my dear!' } })
const transactionB = buildTransaction('set_age', { args: { age: 22 } })
// Using diff contract
const transactionC = buildTransaction('update_state', {
  receiverId: 'my-state-contract.testnet',
  args: { allowed: true },
})

// Optional
const callbackUrl = 'https://my-page.com/callback-success'

// [payable]
contractApi.callMultiple([transactionA, transactionB, transactionC], callbackUrl).then(() => console.log('Done!'))
```

### Cache System

There are two kinds of cache systems to be used. They are `Memory Cache` and `Storage Cache`.

`Memory Cache`: will be cleared when the app refreshes, as its data lives in memory only. <br/>
`Storage Cache`: The data will remain even when the browser tab is refreshed. Data is persisted using Local Storage.

When instantiating a cache, you need to provide the `expirationTime` (in seconds). This is used as the default value of expirantion and to know when the cache should be returned instead of making a real contract call. When the cache expires, a real call to the contract is made. Each contract's method has its own time of expiration.

```ts
// web3Api.ts
import naxios, { StorageCache } from '@wpdas/naxios'

// ...

/**
 * Cached - Greeting Contract API
 */
export const cachedGreetingContractApi = naxiosInstance.contractApi({
  contractId: 'dev-1692221685438-15421910364142',
  cache: new StorageCache({ expirationTime: 5 * 60 }), // 5 minutes
})
```

Then, to use cached `view`, you can just pass the configuration object saying you want to use cached data.

```ts
import { cachedGreetingContractApi } from './web3Api'

// Fetch Greetings [free]
const args: {}
const config: { useCache: true }
// expirationTime: here is optional, if set, will overwrite the default expirationTime set while calling contractApi method
// tag: Tag to identify / differentiate the cache item
// useQueue: Call is in queued mode, so it will wait for the previous call to finish before executing the next one. This is useful to wait previous call calling the same method to finish before executing the next one and getting the cached data if available.

// Expiration time: 10 sec (default: default expiration time set while calling contractApi method)
// Tag: "greeting" (default: undefined)
// useQueue: true (default: false)
// const config: { useCache: true, expirationTime: 10, useQueue: true }
cachedGreetingContractApi.view<string>('get_greeting', args, config).then((response) => console.log(response))
```

### NEAR RPC API

Naxios also provides access to the NEAR RPC API, so that you can query any data you want. Visit [**NEAR RPC API Docs**](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/introduction) to learn how to use it.

```ts
import { rpcApi } from './web3Api'

// Viewing account using Near RPC API
rpcApi
  .query({
    request_type: 'view_account',
    finality: 'final',
    account_id: 'wendersonpires.near',
  })
  .then((data) => console.log('Account Data:', data))
```

## Utils

#### `queueCalls`

`queueCalls` can be used to queue promise function calls so that they are executed linearly one after another.

```ts
import { queueCalls } from '@wpdas/naxios'

const promise1 = queueCalls.queue(() => promiseMethod1())

// This will be resolved after the promise above
const promise2 = queueCalls.queue(() => promiseMethod2())
```

#### `buildTransaction`

The `buildTransaction` method is useful when you need to build a contract's Transaction body, mainly when you want to make [**multiple contract calls**](#contract-multiple-calls-at-once).

[**See reference here.**](#contract-multiple-calls-at-once)

#### `validateNearAddress`

This is used to check if an address is a valid NEAR address.

```ts
import { validateNearAddress } from '@wpdas/naxios'

console.log(validateNearAddress('fake.near')) // true
console.log(validateNearAddress('fake.nears')) // false
console.log(validateNearAddress('fake.testnet')) // true
console.log(validateNearAddress('fake')) // false
```

#### `calculateDepositByDataSize`

Calculate required deposit for data being stored. (~0.00001N per byte) with a bit extra for buffer

```ts
import { calculateDepositByDataSize } from '@wpdas/naxios'

const myData = { age: 22, name: 'user name' }
console.log(calculateDepositByDataSize(myData)) // 0.00087 Near (not yocto NEAR)
```

#### `isClient`

Simple checker to say if this is running on server or client.

```ts
import { isClient } from '@wpdas/naxios'

if (isClient()) {
  console.log('Hi from client')
} else {
  console.log('Hi from server')
}
```
